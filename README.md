# Food API
##
### Practice using Postman to perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations on your new food API.

[] GET all curry dishes. Use the filter feature.
[] Use POST to create some of your favorite foods.
[] Perform a GET operation using the q URL parameter to find any entries that have the pattern of ol in them.
[] GET all foods and sort them by ethnicity.
[] Delete a food from the API by using the DELETE method, and putting in the URL of a specific resource (e.g. http://localhost:8008/food/2)
